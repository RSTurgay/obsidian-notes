Prepare your lab environment
▶ Download and extract the lab archive


Time to build your toolchain
▶ Configure Crosstool-NG
▶ Run it to build your own cross-compiling
toolchain


Time to start the practical lab!
▶ Communicate with the board using a serial
console
▶ Configure, build and install U-Boot SPL and
U-Boot
▶ Learn U-Boot commands
▶ Set up TFTP communication with the board


Time to start the practical lab!
▶ Get the Linux kernel sources
▶ Apply patches

▶ Set up the cross-compiling environment
▶ Configure and cross-compile the kernel for an
arm platform
▶ On this platform, interact with the bootloader
and boot your kernel


▶ Make Linux boot on a directory on your
workstation, shared by NFS
▶ Create and configure a minimalistic Linux
embedded system
▶ Install and use BusyBox
▶ System startup with /sbin/init
▶ Set up a simple web interface
▶ Use shared libraries


▶ Creating partitions on your block storage
▶ Booting your system with a mix of filesystems:
SquashFS for the root filesystem (including
applications), ext4 for configuration and user
data, and tmpfs for temporary system files.


▶ Creating partitions in your internal flash storage
▶ Creating a UBI image with several volumes and
flashing it from U-Boot
▶ Reading the kernel and DTB from UBI volumes
▶ Boot on a UBIFS root filesystem


▶ Rebuild the same system, this time with
Buildroot.
▶ See how easier it gets!
